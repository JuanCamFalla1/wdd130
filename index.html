            <p>Hello! I'm pleased to introduce myself. My name is Camilo, and I'm originally from Colombia, but I'm currently living in Bolivia. I recently decided to pursue my studies, and that's what brings me here.
                Outside of academics, I enjoy skating and swimming.  </p>

            <p> Cochabamba lies in a valley of fertile and productive land at an altitude of 2,558 meters (8,392 feet).
                Surrounded by cultivated fields and valuable pre-Inca and Inca remains, the city 
                preserves its viceregal character while establishing itself as an important agricultural,
                manufacturing, commercial, and industrial center. </p>
